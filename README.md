# largenumber
This is a simple program that is developed to handle the large numbers ie numbers more than long long type.
We do not recomend this project for any kind of user as it is still under development. There may be unknown bugs and memory issues.
It is developed in the simple C without any kind of complication so that anyone can make use of it.
But it is not the right time for the final usage.
